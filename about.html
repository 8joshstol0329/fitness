    <p>The following are common exercises that we encourage our clients to do as part of their daily exercise routine.</p>
    <dl>
        <dt>Burpee</dt>
        <dd>Burpees are a great full-body exercise to increase your strength and endurance. Begin in a standing position, drop into a squat and extend your hands forward, kick your feet back and then forward again quickly, and then jump up from a squatted position.<span class="viewex" onClick="burpees()">view example.</span></dd>
        <dt>Planks</dt>
        <dd>Planks build your core strength. To perform a plank, get in a push-up position and rest your forearms on the floor. Hold the position as long as you can.<span class="viewex" onClick="plank()">view example</span></dd>
        <dt>Mountain Climber</dt>
        <dd>Mountain climbers are a good cardio exercise. Place your hands on the floor in a push-up position, bring one knee up to your chest, and then switch as quickly as you can (as though you are climbing a mountain).<span class="viewex" onClick="mountain()">view example</span></dd>
